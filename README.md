# promptizer
Generates a random prompt for your music or artistic endeavours.

This is honestly a very simple tool. It's just using the JS random functions for like every single function limited by some hard-coded parameters. It's still probably useful.

## ROADMAP
- [x] basic features implemented
- [ ] randomised good luck/get crackin/etc messages for Extra Flair
- [ ] actually make it look good and usable. it looks bad right now.
- [ ] implement parameters to control the randomisation amounts

## THESE MIGHT NOT BE IMPLEMENTED (BUT THEY'RE IDEAS I HAVE RIGHT NOW SO THEY'RE HERE)
- [ ] Random statement generator (i have to get creative with how words and phrases work here. y'see that's a big ask!)
