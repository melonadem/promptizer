      Hi! there's nothing here quite yet, but I'm working on a tool that will:<br>
      * give you a random time limit, if you need one<br>
      * give you a random colour, if you're like me and have synesthesia<br>
      * give you a random theme - simple, one word phrases concatenated together probably????<br>
      * give you a random key to work in<br>
      * give you a random chord progression to work with if you're into that<br><br>

      there's like NO ai or whatever used for this so it'll all be truly unhinged<br>
      (you can try out the randTime() and randColour() scripts in the console)
